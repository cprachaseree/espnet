100-121669-0000 TOM THE PIPER'S SON
100-121669-0001 THE PIG WAS EAT AND TOM WAS BEAT AND TOM RAN CRYING DOWN THE STREET
100-121669-0002 HE NEVER DID ANY WORK EXCEPT TO PLAY THE PIPES AND HE PLAYED SO BADLY THAT FEW PENNIES EVER FOUND THEIR WAY INTO HIS POUCH IT WAS WHISPERED AROUND THAT OLD BARNEY WAS NOT VERY HONEST
100-121669-0003 BUT HE WAS SO SLY AND CAUTIOUS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT OF STEALING ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS HAD BEEN MISSED AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD MAN'S WAY BARNEY HAD ONE SON NAMED TOM
100-121669-0004 AND THEY LIVED ALL ALONE IN A LITTLE HUT AWAY AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE STREET FOR TOM'S MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN HE WAS A BABY YOU MAY NOT SUPPOSE THAT TOM WAS A VERY GOOD BOY SINCE HE HAD SUCH A QUEER FATHER BUT NEITHER WAS HE VERY BAD
100-121669-0005 UNDER HIS FATHER'S GUIDANCE HE FELL INTO BAD WAYS ONE MORNING TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON WAS HUNGRY WHEN THE DAY BEGUN HE WANTED A BUN AND ASKED FOR ONE BUT SOON FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE NONE

100-121669-0007 NO ANSWERED TOM SHAKING HIS HEAD NO ONE WILL GIVE ME A PENNY FOR PLAYING
100-121669-0008 IF I WENT TO HIS HOUSE HE DID LAST WEEK YOU KNOW
100-121669-0009 SO TOM TOOK HIS FATHER'S PIPES AND WALKED OVER THE HILL TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON LEARNED TO PLAY WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
